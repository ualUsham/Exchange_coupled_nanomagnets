# Exchange_coupled_nanomagnets
The project is to predict magnetic properties of "Exchanged Coupled Nanomagnets" using Machine Learning Algorithms. I self collected data from various research papers. Then I applied ML algorithms like Regression, Random forest, Neural Networks, etc on the self collected data after feature engineering during this project.
